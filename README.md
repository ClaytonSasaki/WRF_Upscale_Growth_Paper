# WRF_Upscale_Growth_Paper

Repository for the code used in the following paper: Sasaki, C. R. S., Rowe, A. K., McMurdie, L. A., Varble, A. C., & Zhang, Z. (2025), Environmental Influences on Deep Convective Upscale Growth Rate in Central Argentina from a Convection-Permitting Simulation. Submitted to J. Geophys. Res. Atmos.

This code uses a 6.5-month PNNL WRF run to examine differences in environments that support different rates of convective upscale growth (i.e., the organization of storms into larger systems) in Central Argentina. This work expands upon and confirms hypotheses from case studies of observed upscale growth currently in-review at Monthly Weather Review ([pre-print](https://essopenarchive.org/users/911810/articles/1286208-environmental-conditions-leading-to-observed-convective-organization-in-central-argentina))

Note that the code is configured to grab the data locally and not from the main 'Data/stats' directory in this repository
